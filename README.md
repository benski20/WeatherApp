WeatherApp is a simple, interactive SwiftUI application that displays the current weather and forecast for a location. This app allows users to view the current weather with dynamic background changes for day and night modes, which can be toggled by tapping the "Change Day Time" button. The layout includes a large weather icon, temperature display, and a horizontal scrollable forecast for the upcoming days. Each component, such as the background view, main weather status, and forecast, is modularized for easy customization and readability. This project is an excellent example of SwiftUI's declarative syntax, custom views, and basic state management, making it ideal for beginner and intermediate developers. This project is based on Sean Allen's tutorial on his YouTube channel, and his tutorials/resources have provided this code and design.
